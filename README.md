A lot of times I've wondered: What is the reason people make stuff?
For me, it's just for the fun of making stuff.
But what is creation?
Can you create a new thing by changing something else? Or is it still the same thing.
I may or may not have spray painted a barn, so I want to know if I can call it art.
